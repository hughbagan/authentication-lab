Question 1
----------
It uses the django superuser admins, taken wholesale it seems.


Question 2
----------
Username and password, basic HTTP auth by default.


Question 3
----------
Session based authentication - the server creates a session for the user
when they log in. The session id is stored on a cookie in the user's 
browser. 
Token based authentication (JSON Web Token) - the server creates JWT instead
of sessions. The JWT has a secret and is sent to the client. The client 
stores the JWT locally and includes it in headers.
The difference is that Token based auth stores the user's state in the token
on the client instead of on the server. 
Token authentication is great because the client doesn't need to save any
credentials anywhere (like in Basic authentication).


Question 4
----------
1. The user is given an authorization code link. Basically it links to an
   API authorization endpoint. It also contains the application's client ID,
   a redirect url, and the level of requested access. 
2. The user clicks the link and logs into the service (eg. Google). Then
   the service will prompt to authorize or deny the access to their account.
3. When the user clicks "authorize", the service redirects them along with an
   authorization code.
4. Then the application requests an access token from the API using that 
   authorization code. It also includes the "client secret" to the API
   token endpoint.
5. If the authorization is good, the API will send the access token to the 
   application in a response. 
6. The application is authorized :)
   The token can be used to access the user's account via the service API.
   It's limited to the granted level of access. Eventually the token expires
   or can be revoked. 

Apparently these steps are only one kind of third-party service authorization
type.
